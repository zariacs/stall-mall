Stall Mall

This is an application originally created for a small business client on a university campus that facilitates customer orders from students living on campus and collaborates with the on-campus vendor (client) for order fulfillment and delivery. This app processes customer orders, sends external and internal alerts, facilitates customer and employee logins, and tracks inventory. The alert system includes generic, customizable alerts and employee-generated alerts.

Stall Mall was implemented by a team of two, while being designed and tested by a team of five. We used python with layered architecture to reflect all specified functional and non-functional requirements based on requirement elicitation techniques performed through regular contact with the client. All requirements can be found in the project documentation, which is summarized further below.

The team created and updated software engineering artifacts including use case and architecture diagrams, structure charts, and software design and requirements specification documents.
